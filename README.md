# Recolored Pokémon Emerald Sprites
I've been a Pokémon fan for a long time, with Gen 3 being one of my absolute favorites. There are a lot of improvements Gen 3 did to the franchise like the abilities, IVs, etc. Although something that bugged me a lot were the Pokémon Sprites.
Don't get me wrong, they aren't bad

This is a personal project where i recolor all Gen 2 and 3 Pokemon Sprites from Emerald and make a custom 2nd frame animation for the FRLG sprites so it could be used in Emerald. Feel free to use if you want to.
